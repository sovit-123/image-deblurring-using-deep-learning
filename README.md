# README



* **First of all, you can find the dataset on Kaggle:**

  * **Dataset  => https://www.kaggle.com/kwentar/blur-dataset.**

* Get the dataset and extract it inside the `input` folder. Following is the directory structure for the project:

  ```
  ├───input
  │   ├───defocused_blurred
  │   ├───gaussian_blurred
  │   ├───motion_blurred
  │   └───sharp
  ├───outputs
  │   └───saved_images
  └───src
  ```



## Steps to Execute

* I have not used the blurred images that are given in the original dataset for image deblurring. They are spatially variant due to motion blurring and defocus-blurring. I have added Gaussian blurring to the images using the `add_guassian_blur.py` script inside the `src` folder. Then I have used these images for deblurring.
* **The following is the order of execution:**
  1. `add_gaussian_blur.py`
  2. `deblur_ae.py`
* ***Note: Execute all the scripts while being within the `src` folder inside the terminal***.

## <u>Future Work</u>

* To deblur the spatially variant images inside the `defocused_blurred` and `motion_blurred` folders.
* Add more and better models to `models.py` script. 
* **Any useful contribution to the project is highly appreciated.**
